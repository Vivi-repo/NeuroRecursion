# 🧠 NeuroRecursion

**NeuroRecursion** is a logic-based, recursively wired memory mapping and testing tool. Designed to simulate the learning and forgetting process of a recursive AI, this project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with logic trees, memory pathways, and signal-driven recursion patterns.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📚 **Memory Trees** – Create and traverse logical memory maps
- 🔁 **Recursive Signals** – Test memory through recursive recall logic
- 🧩 **Customizable Nodes** – Add, delete, and modify logic pathways
- 🧠 **Simulated Forgetting** – Erase or override mapped memories
- ✅ **Simple CLI Flow** – Minimal command-line interface for demo purposes

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- No external dependencies (other than `sympy`, included in virtual environment)

---


## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vivi-repo/NeuroRecursion.git
   cd NeuroRecursion
   
💡 Inspiration
This project began as an exploration of recursion and logic trees—but it’s evolved into a sandbox for testing how memory, logic, and structure interact when recursively re-entered. It’s ideal for future AI simulations, educational logic exercises, or just for fun!
